    <h1>The States of Hate in 2019</h1>
    <p>In March 2020, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-and-extremism-2019" target="_blank">annual report</a> documenting hate groups across the U.S., in which it identified 940 active groups in 2019. While the number is down from a peak number of 1,020 in 2018, it notes an increase of three kinds of groups: white nationalist, anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant. For the exploratory project, I focused on <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map" target="_blank">data from 2019, which is visualized in the SPLC's hate map and timeline</a>, along with data dating back to 2010. Inspired by its choropleth map, I attempted to recreate it for the project using the number of <span style="background-color: #f6f578">hate groups per capita for each state</span>. When a state is clicked on, a bar chart of the number of groups by ideology as well as a table of individual hate groups appear. An organization may be listed multiple times if they are located in different municipalities. (Note: The District of Columbia, which has 19 hate groups, is not included on the map.)
