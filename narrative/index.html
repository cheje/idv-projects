          <h1>State of Hate in New York:</h1>

          <p>Horrific images of the Ku Klux Klan in pointed hoods and white robes are ingrained in the minds of Americans when picturing the quintessential hate group in the United States. These days, however, the group is “largely rejected as outmoded by most white supremacists,” <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/03/18/year-hate-and-extremism-2019" target="_blank">according to the Southern Poverty Law Center</a>. Since 1999, the advocacy organization has released a yearly census of active US <span class="def-tooltip">hate groups<span class="def-tooltip-text">"A hate group is an organization that – based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities – has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." — SPLC » Methodology</span></span> in the previous year. The latest data has been used to create the visualizations for this project. Today, the faces of hate do not hide under white cloth. Instead many spread their message from <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/03/18/year-technology-2019" target="_blank">behind computer screens</a> or through <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2020/03/18/spotlight-tactics-flurry-flyering-2019" target="_blank">flyers and banners</a>. This year’s report, “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-and-extremism-2019" target="_blank">The Year in Hate and Extremeism in 2019</a>,” documented 940 active hate groups, down from an all-time high of 1,020 in 2018 and categorized by more than a dozen ideologies – the top five being Black separatist, white nationalist, general hate, anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">With 255 chapters, Black separatist groups led in number but, as the SPLC report points out: "These groups lag far behind the hate groups fueled by various forms of white supremacy." It continues: "Even though they have little to no impact on mainstream politics and no high-level defenders in the media, the two antisemitic terror attacks in the New York City area in 2019 demonstrate that this ideology can influence individuals’ behavior." While absolute numbers give an idea of the scope of organized hate, the influence and impact of a hate group or an ideology is not necessarily measured by its number of locations. Instead it is perhaps based more on whether the operation has infiltrated bodies of power and other means that allow it to expand its reach, have financial and long-term support, and ultimately transform its hatred into normalized beliefs. While raw numbers paint an initial image of the state of hate groups, understanding the context in which it exist or even thrive provides a more comprehensive picture. The visualizations presented here are based on those numbers but they are also an attempt to build on that data and present comparisons and trends, from which further questions could be considered.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">In New York State, the SPLC documented 44 active hate groups last year, 33 of which included the municipality where they were located while 11 operated at a statewide level. The map above gives an overview of where hate groups exist. Hovering over the dots will give a list of the groups by ideology. Most of those municipalities, all located in the lower half of the state, have 1-3 groups, from the large cities of Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse down to Hopewell Junction and Fishkill in Dutchess County, population at under 400 and 2,080, respectively. Then there are the five boroughs of New York City, which is home to half of the state's hate groups. While Black separatist groups are found in cities all within the top 10 most populated in the state where more than 60,000 live, the municipalities with under 50,000 residents have groups that belong to anti-Muslim, general hate, radical traditional Catholicism, and white nationalist ideologies. How did leaders choose those locations? What factors in their environment prompted them to pursue a mission of hatred? Meanwhile in New York City, considered one of the most diverse cities in the country, neighborhood gentrification, disparate enforcement of the law, and school segregation persist. There, all of the aforementioned ideologies with the exception of radical traditional Catholicism are found. In which kind of municipality would a hate group thrive? A town where most locals share similar social and economic experiences? Or a metropolis with millions of people from varying backgrounds?</p>

          <p>The visualizations further down focus on the ideologies noted on the map’s tooltips.</p>

          <p>The grouped bar chart below compares the percentages of each ideology in New York and the country as a whole using relative, as opposed to absolute, numbers.This kind of chart frames the data in another perspective: comparing it with the states overall and then seeing what actually has a higher share of the whole in New York – which, as highlighted in the darker bars, turns out to be Anti-Muslim, Black separatist, general hate, hate music, radical traditional Catholicism and white nationalist groups – while noting that the higher proportion for these five ideologies is all under 5%, not a significant disparity. Nonetheless, this can still prompt a look into the state-specific environments that contribute to the formation of these groups.</p>

          See the number of hate groups belonging to an ideology as a percentage of the total hate groups in New York State and in the US in 2019. For example, New York has two documented anti-LGBTQ groups, or 4.5% of the 44 hate groups in the state while the US has 70 groups, or 7.4% of the 940 hate groups in the country. The darker bars higlight the ideologies where New York has a higher proportion than the US.

          <p>Returning to New York State data, the line chart that follows presents one ideology at a time and its growth or decline over the past two decades. A bit of context is added into the background, with light red based on the years of a Republican president and light blue of a Democratic one. Could an increase in groups of a particular ideology be, in part, a response to the election of a president? Anti-Muslim groups, for example, first appeared and steadily increased in New York during Barack Obama’s first term before decreasing in his second term. White nationalist groups followed the same trajectory but, like anti-Muslim groups, that path started nudging up again toward or at the end of Obama’s term and into Donald Trump’s.</p>

      <p>Given the relatively small changes, in the context of raw data, from one year to the next, and the need to consider other factors besides political parties in power, the visualization is more for seeing overall time trends rather than emphasizing specific numbers. And the questions these trends might trigger, especially when the data might not follow expectations.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:2em;">The final visualization presents only text and in doing so, intends to give another perception of the size of the data. In the table, see the names of all the hate groups in New York, sorted by ideology and city. From strictly the standpoint of raw numbers, 44 data points is a comparatively small set. But scrolling through and taking in the names of each hate group in the state can perhaps give another impression – that in the end, in the context of hate groups and not of data points, 44 is indeed a substantial number.
